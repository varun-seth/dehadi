        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: 2025-01-01</p>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is
            handled in our app.
        </p>

        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
            We do not collect, store, use, or share any personal information
            about you when you visit our website.
        </p>

        <h2 id="disclosure">Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
            Our App is fully offline and primarily stores all data within your browser's local storage.
            We do not transmit or share your data to our server or any third-party services.
            All your data remains on your device unless you choose to back it up or sync it using
            third-party services like Google Drive or Dropbox.
        </p>

        <h2>Dropbox</h2>
        <p>
            The application allows you to login with your Dropbox account to enable
            cloud backup and sync of your data into the storage of your personal Dropbox account.
        </p>

        <h2>Consent</h2>
        <p>
            This app works by letting you access your Dropbox files via this app.
            This app will continously read and write to files inside a folder with prefix "Karma", and
            does not have access to any other files in your Dropbox.
            By logging in via Dropbox, you consent to this app accessing your Dropbox files.
        </p>
        <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/account/connected_apps">
            https://www.dropbox.com/account/connected_apps
        </a>

        <h2>Logout</h2>
        <p>
            After signing-in via Dropbox, the authorization to access your Dropbox files
            is kept only in your browser. Logging out will delete this
            authorization from your browser. Once logged out, this app does not
            have any access to your Dropbox or any other data.
        </p>

        <h2>No Tracking</h2>
        <p>
            We do not track you. The app is hosted on GitHub Pages and is
            purely a frontend application without any backend processing. No
            login or tracking mechanisms are implemented on our side.
            No ads are shown. No analytics tools are used.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            Our app uses Dropbox API for accessing Dropbox files. We
            do not control the privacy practices of Dropbox. Please refer to
            Dropbox's privacy policy for more information.
            The Dropbox calls are only initiated after you explicitly click
            the "Connect to Dropbox" button. And are disabled when you
            click on "Disconnect from Dropbox". After disconnecting,
            the app does not have any access to your Dropbox, and no longer calls the Dropbox API.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time, although it is
            highly unlikely. Thus, you are advised to review this page
            periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by
            posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
        </p>
